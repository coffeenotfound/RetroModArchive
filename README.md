# RetroModArchive
Retro Mod Archive is an archive of various old—but not forgotten—modifications for the game Minecraft.
We believe that Mods are part of Minecraft history and thus strive to preserve all mods for older versions of the game we can get our hands on.

If you are in possession of an old mod that you wish to share with us to catalog in our archive, you can contact us via <code.katzer@gmail.com>.

## Disclaimer
In an afford to preserve Mods, we download and store them ourselves. We understand that some mod creators do not wish to have their work hosted by third parties, so we do our best to provide the original links shared by the creators, where it is still possible.
If you are the author of one of the hosted mods and want us to remove any reference to your work anyways, you can contact us via <code.katzer@gmail.com>. (And we'll be sad)

## Mod Links
Please consider only using the direct links should the original links be broken as many mod authors use AdFly or similar services for monetization.
